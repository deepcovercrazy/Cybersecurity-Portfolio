## üìå Summary
Hydra successfully identified 6 valid passwords for the user admin.

The tested passwords were simple and commonly used, demonstrating weak password security.

Using a small password list (quick.txt) made the testing process efficient and quick.

This confirms the vulnerability of DVWA to brute force attacks at this security level.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conclusion
The brute force attack on DVWA using Hydra demonstrates how weak or default passwords can be exploited. Always use strong, unique passwords and consider implementing protections like account lockouts or rate limiting.
