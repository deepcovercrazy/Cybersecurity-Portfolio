# 🔓 SQL Injection Exploitation Report – DVWA (Low Security)

## 📘 Summary
This report demonstrates a successful exploitation of a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) with security level set to "Low". The objective was to extract data from the backend database using basic SQLi techniques.

---

## 🧪 Target Information

- **Target Application:** DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)
- **Security Level:** Low
- **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
- **Test URL:** `http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli/`

---

## 🔍 Vulnerability Overview

The SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the user input field where the input is not properly sanitized before being embedded into a SQL query.

The likely vulnerable query in source code:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '$id';
```
🧭 Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the SQL Injection Page
Navigate to:

DVWA > SQL Injection

You'll see a user input form like:
User ID: [ ______ ] [Submit]

2. Initial Payload – Authentication Bypass / Dump All Records

Used the following input:

1' OR '1'='1
![sqli all users.png](file:///C:/Users/moham/OneDrive/Documents/sqli-all-users.png.png)

Result:
All user records were returned. This confirms that the input is directly embedded into a SQL query without sanitization.



3.Column Count Discovery

To prepare for a UNION SELECT, column count was discovered using:

1' ORDER BY 1-- 
1' ORDER BY 2-- 
1' ORDER BY 3-- 
![sqli db version.png](file:///C:/Users/moham/OneDrive/Documents/sqli-db-version.png.png)

Finding: 2 columns exist in the original SELECT query

4.Union-based SQL Injection – Retrieve Database Version

1' UNION SELECT 'version', @@version-- 

![sqli db name.png](file:///C:/Users/moham/OneDrive/Documents/sqli-db-name.png.png)

Result:
The database version (e.g., 10.5.18-MariaDB) was shown in place of one of the name fields.



5. Retrieve Current Database Name

1' UNION SELECT 'database', database()-- 

![sqli orderby.png](file:///C:/Users/moham/OneDrive/Documents/sqli-orderby.png.png)

Result:
The current database name (likely dvwa) was displayed.

✅ Vulnerability Analysis

The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to dynamic query construction using unsanitized user input.

The attack allowed reading database data without authentication or access control.

Data exfiltration was successful using UNION SELECT.

📎 Notes

This test was conducted in a controlled local environment using DVWA in Kali Linux. All actions were taken for educational and ethical purposes only.
