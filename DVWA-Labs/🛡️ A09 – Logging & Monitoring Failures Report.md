# üõ°Ô∏è A09 ‚Äì Logging & Monitoring Failures Report

\*\*Date:\*\* 2025-07-09  
\*\*Environment:\*\* Kali Linux  
\*\*Scope:\*\* SSH Logging, Monitoring, Log Rotation & Alerting

---

## 1. SSH Server Setup & User Creation ‚öôÔ∏è

- Installed SSH server: `openssh-server`  
- Enabled and started SSH service:  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable ssh.service
  sudo systemctl start ssh.service
  ```
* Created test user: `testuser` for SSH login tests

* Verified SSH service status:

systemctl status ssh.service

Status: active (running)

## 2. Authentication Testing üîê

* Performed successful SSH login with:
```
    ssh testuser@localhost
```

* Accepted password, connection established.

* Performed multiple failed SSH login attempts by entering wrong password intentionally.

* Verified SSH authentication logs using:

sudo journalctl -u ssh.service --since "10 minutes ago"

* Logs include both successful and failed login attempts, e.g.:

Jul 09 18:00:10 kali sshd[12345]: Accepted password for testuser from 127.0.0.1 port 54321 ssh2

Jul 09 18:01:15 kali sshd[12345]: Failed password for testuser from 127.0.0.1 port 54322 ssh2

Jul 09 18:01:20 kali sshd[12345]: Failed password for testuser from 127.0.0.1 port 54323 ssh2

Jul 09 18:01:25 kali sshd[12345]: Failed password for testuser from 127.0.0.1 port 54324 ssh2

## 3. Log Rotation Configuration üîÑ
* Verified log rotation configuration files:

cat /etc/logrotate.conf

cat /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog

* Confirmed log files will be rotated and archived regularly to prevent excessive disk usage.

## 4. Alerting and Intrusion Prevention with Fail2Ban üö®
* Checked if Fail2Ban is installed:

systemctl status fail2ban

* Installed and enabled Fail2Ban to monitor SSH logs and ban IPs after repeated failed login attempts:

sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban

* ested Fail2Ban by multiple failed SSH login attempts

* Checked Fail2Ban status and jail info for sshd:

    sudo fail2ban-client status sshd

    Confirmed IP banning mechanism is active.

## 5. Summary & Recommendations ‚úÖ

| Checkpoint                   | Status    |
| ---------------------------- | --------- |
| SSH service running          | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Authentication logs created  | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Log rotation configured      | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Fail2Ban installed & active  | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| Alerts for repeated failures | ‚úÖ Enabled |

Recommendations:
* Maintain continuous monitoring and alerting on authentication logs

* Consider centralized log management (e.g., ELK stack, Wazuh)

* Harden SSH by disabling root login and enforcing key-based authentication

* Schedule regular review of logs and Fail2Ban actions
