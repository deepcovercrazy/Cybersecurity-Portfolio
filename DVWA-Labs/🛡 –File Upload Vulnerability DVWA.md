## 🧪 2. Environment Setup  

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux  
- **Testing Platform:** DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)  
- **Security Level:** Low  
- **Target Page:** `http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/upload/`  
- **Browser:** Firefox

## ⚙️ 3. Vulnerability Discovery

- Navigated to **File Upload** section in DVWA.
- Created a malicious PHP file named `shell.php`:

```php
<?php
echo "It works! File Upload Vulnerability!";
?>
```
Uploaded the file successfully.
![File upload](file:///C:/Users/moham/OneDrive/Desktop/File%20upload.png)
The application responded:
"The file shell.php has been uploaded to the uploads folder."

Accessed the uploaded file via:

http://localhost/DVWA/hackable/uploads/shell.php

Output confirmed execution:

It works! File Upload Vulnerability!
![File Upload Vulnerability](file:///C:/Users/moham/OneDrive/Desktop/File%20Upload%20Vulnerability.png)

🔐 5. Mitigation Recommendations
Restrict allowed file types (e.g., only .jpg, .png).

Validate file content (MIME type + magic bytes).

Store uploaded files outside web root.

Rename files on upload to prevent direct access.

Disable script execution in upload directory (.htaccess, Apache config).

✅ 6. Conclusion
The DVWA application allows execution of arbitrary uploaded files, leading to remote code execution. This could allow a real attacker to compromise the server.
